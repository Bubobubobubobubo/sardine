# MIDI Naive

MIDI Naive is a small fun summer project made using asyncio and the [mido(https://github.com/mido/mido) MIDI library. It is an attempt to get a small MIDI Clock and MIDI scheduling library ready for sequencing synthesizers and hardware drum machines on-the-fly. For the time being, I will try to support the whole range of MIDI messages before trying to branch out using OSC.

## Installation

Installation is pretty simple:
1) run `setup.py` using `pip3 install -e .` to download required libraries and install the library.
2) open a new interactive session using `python3 -m asyncio` (**/a\\ You need the asyncio bit!**).
3) import the library `from midi_naive import *`

# Usage

As of now, nothing is properly working \o/. Wait a bit until I do a proper release. Feel free to jump in if you have a crazy idea you would like to try out.
