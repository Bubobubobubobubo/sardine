# Installation

This section will guide you through the installation of Sardine. Sardine is a multi-layered system:
- **Sardine and Fishery:** the Python parts of the system.
- **SuperCollider (for sound only):** optional audio backend.
- **Dependencies:** C++ dependencies for MIDI and Ableton Link.

Installing Sardine can be... a process! :) Once you get it to work, you won't have any trouble at all
configuring it and tweaking it to your liking.
