    The `Scheduler.deferred` attribute is used to control if AsyncRunner
    runs with an implicit time shift when calling its function or not.
    This helps improve sound synchronization by giving the function
    more time to execute. For example, assuming bpm = 120, `deferred=False`
    would expect its function to complete instantaneously,
    whereas `deferred=True` would allow a function with `p=1`
    to finish execution within 500ms (1 beat) instead.

    In either case, if the function takes too long to execute, it will miss
    its scheduling deadline and cause an unexpected gap between function calls.

    An interval defines the amount of time between each execution

    of 0.5s and a period of 2 beats means each interval is 1 second.

    Through interval shifting, a function can switch between different
    periods/tempos and then compensate for the clock's current time to
    avoid the next immediate beat being shorter than expected.

    Initially, functions have an interval shift of 0. The runner
    will automatically change its interval shift when the function
    schedules itself with a new period or a change in the clock's beat
    duration occurs. This can lead to functions with the same period
    running at different phases. To synchronize these functions together,
    their interval shifts should be set to the same value (usually 0).

    The `delay_interval()` method combines this with interval shifting
    to properly delay a runner and its interval until the given deadline.

    Once this time has been passed and the next iteration was run,
    this attribute will be reset to `None`.

    Note that deferred states will take priority over this, and in fact even
    replace the snap, if one or more of those states specify a deadline earlier
    than the current snap's deadline.
